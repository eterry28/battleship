# Battleship 

There are 2 boards, one for each player (which cannot be seen by her opponent). The idea of the game is to guess where your opponent’s ships are and sink them. To win one must sink all of her opponent’s ships.

**Basic Rules:** 
The board is divided into columns labeled by letters and rows labeled by numbers. Each
player receives 5 ships and places them on his board. The players take turns guessing the position of their opponent’s ships. The opponent must answer “hit” or “miss” depending on whether or not the player guessed a square occupied by the opponent’s ship or not. Each guess is recorded on the player’s own board so she can remember if it was a ‘miss’ or ‘hit’ (and avoid redundant guesses.) Ships vary in size, but are rectangular. Each player has a Board object that consists of 5 Ships occupying positions on them. The ships can be of different sizes.
